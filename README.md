# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone
<i> This repository introduces the capstone project for IBM's Data Science Professional Certification. It will introduce a problem and apply location data and analysis methods to present a business solution. </i>


## <b> 1). Introduction to Business Problem </b>
Chicago is one of the most populous and growing US cities in the country. It is the home to plenty of arts, entertainment, sports, education, research and much more. No wonder Bean-town is attracting plenty of young professionals moving into the busy city each year. Chicago is a relatively young city with the person's average age being 34.9 years old and 63% of the population being single out of 2.7 million residents and growing.

With a growing city full of young people moving to Chicago looking for entertainment and adjusting to life in a new city, there has been demand on creating programs to research and provide information to those new to the city, create guides for tourists and keep the city's economy booming.

In this project, we will use location data and clustering techniques to determine which areas of Chicago has the most activity and human traffic. This can help a new city transplant select which is an accessible and quiet neighborhood to potentially select their new home.

## <b> 2). Data Sources: Downloading & Prepping Data </b>
The data sources used in this project consist of:
1. Wikipedia: List of Chicago neighborhood data

   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_Chicago

This data source contains a list of the different neighborhoods in Chicago which will be utilized to cluster into larger sections of the city.

2. Foursquare API: Retrieved different venues in the different neighborhoods of Chicago
Foursquare API data will be used to determine the different venues located around the city. The different venues that will be obtained from location data will include restaurants,and entertainment (theaters, bars, gyms etc.).
Combining the neighborhood clusters and populating the different types of venues within each neighborhood will help determine which part of the city is will contain the necessities for daily life and entertainment with low human traffic within the area. 

## <b> 3). Methodology </b>

<ul>
<li>Build a dataframe of neighborhoods in Chicago, IL by web scraping data from a Wikipedia page.</li>
<li>Get the geographical coordinates of the different neighborhoods.</li>
<li>Obtain the venue data for the neighborhoods from Foursquare API.</li>
<li>Explore and cluster the neighborhoods.</i>
<li>Select the best cluster that is the most convenient, but quiet location for living.</li>
</ul>
